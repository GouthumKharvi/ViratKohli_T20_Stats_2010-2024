# Excel Functions for Data Analysis

## VLOOKUP
- **Description**: `VLOOKUP` is used to search for a value in the first column of a range and return a value in the same row from another column.
- **Example**: 
  - **Country**: Zimbabwe, South Africa, Afghanistan, New Zealand
  - **Runs**: 26, 56, 112, 14

  ### Explanation of `=VLOOKUP("Afghanistan", R14:S17, 2, FALSE)`

- **`VLOOKUP`**: This is the function name, which stands for "Vertical Lookup." It searches for a value in the first column of a table and returns a value in the same row from a specified column.

- **`"Afghanistan"`**: This is the **lookup_value**. It specifies the value you want to find in the first column of the table. In this case, you're searching for the value "Afghanistan."

- **`R14:S17`**: This is the **table_array**. It defines the range of cells that contains the data you want to search through. Here, the table is located in the range from cell `R14` to `S17`, where:
  - Column `R` contains the values you want to search for ("Afghanistan").
  - Column `S` contains the values you want to retrieve.

- **`2`**: This is the **col_index_num**. It specifies the column number in the table_array from which to retrieve the value. In this case, `2` means you want to get the value from the second column of the specified range (column `S`).

- **`FALSE`**: This is the **range_lookup**. Setting this to `FALSE` means you want an exact match for "Afghanistan." If `FALSE` is used, VLOOKUP will only return a value if it finds an exact match. If no exact match is found, it will return an error.

### Summary

The formula `=VLOOKUP("Afghanistan", R14:S17, 2, FALSE)` searches for "Afghanistan" in the first column of the range `R14:S17`. Once it finds "Afghanistan", it retrieves the corresponding value from the second column of that range (column `S`). If "Afghanistan" is not found, it will return an error.
